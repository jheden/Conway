# Conway's Game of Life
Way too ambitious, but when I get a task, I run with it.

# Features
Built in a 1D array
Color trails indicating amount of time alive or dead (pretty!)
Simulation speed changing
Drawing on grid
Filling grid with varying amounts
Zoom (although I didn't get around to letting you move around after zooming - yet)
Rewind (I really need to fix that implementation, but it works well if the simulation hasn't been running for too long)
